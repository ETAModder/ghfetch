# GHfetch
**GHfetch** is a program written in GreyScript for the game GreyHack/Grey Hack.  
It is essentially a port of neofetch to EllipseOS (the grey hack operating system)  
It has lots of nice information relating to both your system and your network and some other stuff.

You can now submit **themes**! Just submit a PR with your theme in the ```/themes``` folder.  
Themes should be based off of the original ```ghfetch.src``` but all design can be changed.

*Compile and star GHfetch today to say "I use Ellipse BTW"!*
