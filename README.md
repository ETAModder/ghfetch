# GHfetch
**GHfetch** is a program written in GreyScript for the game GreyHack/Grey Hack.  
It is essentially a port of neofetch to EllipseOS (the grey hack operating system)  
It has lots of nice information relating to both your system and your network and some other stuff.

*Compile and star GHfetch today to say "I use Ellipse BTW"!*
